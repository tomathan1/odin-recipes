    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>½ cup warm water (100° to 110°)</li>
       <li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar </li>
       <li>1 package dry yeast (about 2 1/4 teaspoons)</li>
       <li>3.65 ounces white rice flour (about 3/4 cup)</li>
       <li>1.4 ounces sweet white sorghum flour (about 1/3 cup)</li>
       <li>1.4 ounces tapioca flour (about 1/3 cup)</li>
       <li>1.7 ounces potato starch (about 1/3 cup)</li>
       <li>.9 ounce flaxseed meal (about 1/4 cup)</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon xanthan gum</li>
       <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
       <li>2 large egg whites</li>
       <li>1 large egg</li>
       <li>¾ cup lower-sodium marinara sauce (such as Dell'Amore)</li>
       <li>4 ounces part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 1 cup)</li>
       <li>2 ounces sliced turkey pepperoni</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons grated fresh Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 1/2 cup water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl, stirring with a whisk. Let stand 5 minutes or until yeast mixture is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Weigh or lightly spoon flours, potato starch, and flaxseed meal into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Combine flours, potato starch, flaxseed meal, xanthan gum, and salt in a large bowl; beat with a mixer at medium speed until blended. Add yeast mixture, 1 tablespoon oil, egg whites, and egg; beat at low speed 1 minute or until combined. Increase speed to medium; beat 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Coat a baking sheet with 1 teaspoon oil. Scrape dough onto pan. Lightly coat hands with oil. Press dough into a 14-inch circle, coating hands with oil as needed to prevent dough from sticking. Coat top of dough with any remaining oil. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place (85°), free from drafts, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°.</li>
        <li>Remove plastic wrap, and bake crust at 400° for 17 minutes or until bottom lightly browns. Cool completely. Increase oven temperature to 425°.</li>
        <li>Spread marinara over crust, leaving a 1/2-inch border; top with mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, and Parmesan cheese. Bake at 425° for 16 minutes or until crust is golden and cheese melts.</li>
    </ol>
